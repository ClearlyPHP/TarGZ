# Clearly PHP TarGZ Creation tool

After discovering that PharData has a [known memory leak](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=81017),
and is not recommended to be used _at all_, we needed a standard way of creating TarGz's
that will be simple and portable.

This uses the fantastic code from [splitbrain/php-archive](https://github.com/splitbrain/php-archive) and
is simply a wrapper around it.
